# challenge-2-portfolio

## Description

This challenge involved making a portfolio that could be used to showcase my skills and projects to employers.

I utilized HTML, CSS, flexbox, and media queries to build a responsive and interactive portfolio that displays information about me, the projects I've completed or will complete and my contact information.

I learned how to utilize flexbox mechanics and media queries effectively. I also practiced HTML and CSS elements I've learned about previously.
